# Devops

## Task

- Write a pipeline that will deploy an "hello world" web app to Kubernetes
- The CI/CD system (where the pipeline resides) and the Kubernetes cluster should be on separate systems
- The web app should be accessible remotely and only with HTTPS

## Requirements

- The submission (code/scripts) must be checked into a repository (eg. Github, Gitlab, BitBucket etc.) 
- The submission must include clear instructions to run the code/scripts/commands to produce the setup. 
- No restriction on the tool/framework/programming language. 
- No restriction on use of any of the public clouds - GCP/AWS/Azure. 
- No restriction on use of any open source tools or libraries. 
- Explain in detail how these libraries/tools work internally. If you are unsure about their internals, it is better to avoid using them and go with a simpler, more understandable approach instead.

## Goal
- The assignment is open ended and the point of the exercise is to assess code modularity, usability, extensibility and debuggability. 
- Working solution with scope/ideas for improvement and their pros/cons which will be discussed in a follow up meeting.
